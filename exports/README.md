Exports
======

Everything in this folder is automatically generated by Makefile and build
scripts, to generate a new export, ensure `palette.json` has been updated and
saved, then simple run `make` in project root.

If you want to generate only a single config, say `txt`, run `make exports/quadim.txt`

### Tracking

Even though these files are generated, it is useful to have access to them, so
we track these files with git.
